Retirement Planner

As a part of winning the first contract to help one of the biggest credit unions my area, i'm using the power of Python and API's to create a tool that helps members assess their financial health.

The credit union board wants to allow the union's members to assess their monthly personal finances, and also be able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.

I have created two financial analysis tools:

The first is a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The second tool is a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then runs a Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 5, 10 and 30 years and calculates the expected portfolio returns for a specific initial investment amount.
